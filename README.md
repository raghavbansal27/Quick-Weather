Checking the weather seems fairly trivial: Open your web browser, click the
address bar, type the URL to a weather website (or search for one and then
click the link), wait for the page to load, look past all the ads, and so on.

Actually, there are a lot of boring steps you could skip, if you had a program
that download the weather forecast and print it as plaintext.
